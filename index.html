          <p>
            First off this is the main page for our group. All will have access to it.<br /><br/>
            At present I JohnL3 will be the only person updating it.<br /><br/>The main part on top will be links to individuals pages where they will document briefly what they are studying, write short reviews of what they are studying, ask for help on areas they are stuck on, and add links to there work.<br /><br/>
              Each of us in the group can then go to each persons page and see what each is doing and compare our own plan of learning to others and try out things others are doing and recommended.<br/>
              we can also offer help/advice or ask questions based on what they have posted .... this would have to be done in the slack channel letslearnBackend.<br /><br/>Participants are <strong>Not</strong> required to do this but only if they wish.<br/> Joining and participating in the group and doing things this way is totally <strong>voluntarily</strong><br/><br/>
              I am not going to be telling people to update their pages .... the choice is totally theirs.

        <div class="future-about">
          <p>
            At a future date I would like this page to be hosted on a server and that we could update our pages like a blog, So theres one goal to aim for.<br/><br/>
            Also if someone more experienced than me can suggest a better way of doing what Im trying to do please make suggestions .... all advice is welcome.
